# PhotoAttendance
Initially started as a 24hr hackathon project for Dubhacks 2017, this System aims to take advantage of existing Facial Recognition API (currently using Microsoft Cognitive Service Face API), to speed up the time to take attendance.

If anyone is interested in coming up with new feature, or just want to help out. Shoot me an email at <mailto>jamesw96@uw.edu </mailto>
